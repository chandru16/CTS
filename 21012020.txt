1. Difference between enumeration and enum-
	Enumeration is an interface, an object that implements the Enumeration interface generates a series of elements, one at a time. Successive calls to the nextElement method return successive elements of the series.
	for (Enumeration<E> e = v.elements(); e.hasMoreElements();)
     	 System.out.println(e.nextElement());
  
	Enum is a data type, an enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it.
	public enum Day {
   	 SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
    	THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY 
	}

2. Changing color of nested div-
	<servlet>
	.colorr:nth-child(1)
	{
		Color:red;
	}
	</servlet>
	
	<div class="colorr">
	hello,<span>Hii there</span><span>
	<div>Letsbegin</div>

3. Child selector-
	Child Selector is used to match all the elements which are child of a specified element. It gives the relation between two elements. The element > element selector selects those elements which are the children of specific parent. The operand on the left side of > is the parent and the operand on the right is the children element.

    <head>  
        <title>  
            CSS child Selector  
        </title>  
        <style>  
            div > p {  
                color:white;  
                background: green;  
                padding:2px;  
            }  
        </style>  
    </head>  
      
    <body style = "text-align: center;">  
        <div>  
            <h2 style = "color:green;">  
                CSS Child Selector  
            </h2>  
              
            <p>  
                A computer science portal.  
            </p>  
        </div>  
          
        <p> questions</p>  
          
        <p>This paragraph will not be styled.</p>  
    </body>  
</html> 

4. Pseudo Class
	A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.
a:link {
  color: #FF0000;
}
a:visited {
  color: #00FF00;
}
a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
}
a:active {
  color: #0000FF;
}
